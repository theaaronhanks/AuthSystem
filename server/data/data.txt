You can decide how to manage and store the data for the program.
You may assume that the files are only accessible through the program,
which means you don't need to worry about OS permissions and such
on the files.

You will have a number of files, each storing a different kind of data.
At the very least you'll have:

passwd.txt
access.txt (see assn description for more info)
calcs.txt
logs.txt
